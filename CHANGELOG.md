# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Releases before 0.4.0 are listed at
[github.com/only-cli/oc/releases](https://github.com/only-cli/oc/releases).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `oc node search` no longer lists a property's type line as a heading of
  its own. `Type: {AbortSignal}` under `abortController.signal` passed as a
  heading because it contains the word `signal`, and 74 such lines in the
  live corpus came back as results linking to ids the pages do not have.
- `oc node search fetch` now finds `fetch`, and so do `__dirname` and the
  N-API functions: the corpus keeps backticks in their names, which kept 920
  headings out of the results. A section inside a page now links to its own
  heading instead of the page top.

## 0.5.8

### Fixed

- A same-document or `mailto:` link keeps its number again, just without a
  URL, so `do` reads it instead of fetching anything. 0.5.7 turned these into
  plain text, and on Ruby's docs, where each method signature links to its
  own id, `find` then borrowed the number above the signature and `read`
  opened the previous method.

## 0.5.7

### Fixed

- `oc do` on a `mailto:` link no longer fetches the email's domain. The URL
  was not http(s), so fetch prefixed `https://`, and `mailto:hi@example.com`
  became a GET of example.com with password `hi`. Same-document `#fragment`
  links, which only refetched the page already open, are no longer numbered
  as followable. A hash on a different path (`/item?id=1#comments`) still is.
- A response that sends both `Max-Age` and `Expires` is read the way RFC 6265
  asks, `Max-Age` first, so a logout that sends `Max-Age=0` alongside a future
  `Expires` clears the cookie instead of keeping it. A `Max-Age` too large for
  a date to name is ignored rather than throwing `Invalid time value`, which
  used to take down the whole request over one cookie.
- The `type` on an input is matched case-insensitively, as HTML defines it.
  `type=HIDDEN` was numbered as a field and its value printed by `raw`,
  `type=SUBMIT` came out as an input rather than a button, and a login wall
  written with `type=PASSWORD` was not detected as one.
- The footer offers `do <n>` on a page whose links are headings, which is how
  a search engine writes a result title, and `find` offers it on such a hit
  too. Both counted only link blocks, so on a page of results the line an
  agent reads for what to run next was the one line missing `do`.
- `oc do [2]` and `oc read [2]` take the bracketed form the compact view
  prints, not only the bare number.
- A cookie whose `Path` the server wrapped in quotes, the way ASP.NET and
  several Java containers write `Path="/admin"`, is scoped to the path it
  names rather than to the quotes around it. The quotes were stored as part
  of the path, which then matched nothing, so the cookie was silently never
  sent again and a login looked gone on the page it was scoped to.

## 0.5.6

### Fixed

- Cookies are sent in RFC 6265 order, the longest path first, so a server that
  reads one value for a name gets the cookie scoped to the page it is serving
  rather than whichever arrived first. Two cookies of one name reach the same
  request now that identity is name, domain, and path, and a refresh keeps the
  place the old value held instead of moving to the back of the jar.
- A relative link is resolved against the page's `<base href>` when it sets
  one, not against the URL that served the HTML. Docs generators and mirrors
  put a base in the head so `intro.html` points at the real tree, and `oc do`
  was following the mirror instead. `--json` carries the base alongside the
  page URL when the two differ.
- A leading `@` in a site path is read as the handle rather than encoded to
  `%40`. `oc x user @openai` opened a different user, and the `@` in
  `oc yt channel @Google` doubled the one YouTube's template already carries.
  A search query still encodes it, because there the mention is what is being
  looked for.
- A cookie is replaced only by a Set-Cookie with the same name, domain, and
  path, the identity RFC 6265 gives it. A refresh from `www.example.com` was
  swallowing a login seeded for `example.com`, which left later requests to
  the parent domain and its other subdomains with no credentials.
- A Sphinx object whose index stores the sentinel `-` now links to the HTML
  id the docs actually use (`{objtype}-{fullname}`). `oc py search json` was
  emitting `#-` for the module heading, which is `#module-json` on
  docs.python.org; the same sentinel covers env vars, opcodes, and pdb
  commands.
- A gzip HTML body through an HTTP proxy is read as the page, not as gzip
  bytes. Native fetch already decodes Content-Encoding; the proxy transport
  talks Node's http parser, which does not, so a proxied gzip response was
  charset-decoded as binary noise. The decompressed size is what counts
  against the 25MB cap, so a tiny gzip of a huge body is refused the same
  way an uncompressed one is.
- An icon link (an image, or an empty anchor with aria-label or title) is
  still a numbered link. Those names already worked on icon buttons; without
  them a logo or icon had no textContent and `oc do` could not follow it.
- An RSS 2.0 entry is opened by the URL in its `<link>` text. The HTML parser
  treats `<link>` as void, so that URL was never read, and `oc do` followed the
  guid instead: a WordPress-style id (`isPermaLink="false"`) or nothing when
  the item had no guid, which is how HN's feed is written. The full post in
  `content:encoded` is rendered rather than the excerpt in `description`.

## 0.5.5

### Fixed

- The session store is created owner-only (`0700`) and tightened on every save,
  so a permissive umask no longer leaves `~/.only-cli/sessions` listable or
  writable by other local accounts. An owner-only cookie jar means nothing
  inside a directory someone else can unlink from or write to.
- The cookie file-mode test asks the filesystem whether it stores permission
  bits instead of checking the platform, so it no longer fails on a Windows
  checkout (the 0.5.4 known failure) or on a scratch disk without them, and
  names the skip with its reason rather than asserting something weaker. The
  page snapshot's mode, which had no test, is covered the same way.
- A page served in another encoding than UTF-8 (Shift_JIS, EUC-KR, GBK,
  windows-1252) reads as its text instead of a run of U+FFFD. The charset comes
  from the Content-Type header, then the page's `<meta>` tag or a feed's XML
  declaration, on every transport; a page that declares none is still UTF-8.
  A UTF-8 byte order mark is dropped, so a JSON answer that starts with one
  parses.
- A charset survives a Content-Type header the server sent twice, where the
  two values arrive joined by a comma, and a declaration no browser knows
  (a feed's `encoding="cp949"`) falls through to the page's `<meta>` rather
  than ending the search.
- The impers transport measures a body against the size cap in the bytes that
  arrived, not the characters they decode to, so a page in a CJK encoding no
  longer counts as half its size, and a streaming response is read through its
  text instead of a getter that throws when nothing is buffered. `--verbose`
  counts the body's bytes for the same reason.

### Changed

- A session can no longer be named after a Win32 device: `con`, `prn`, `aux`,
  `nul`, `com0`-`com9`, `lpt0`-`lpt9`, or any of those before the first period.
  Windows reads such a path as the device rather than a file, which would leave
  a cookie jar on NUL. Node 24 on Windows 11 writes a real file and oc has no
  failure to show for it, so this guards the name, it does not fix a bug.
- CI runs the suite on Windows as well as Linux.
- The README no longer promises mode `0600` on Windows, where the mode carries
  no secrecy and the directory's ACL is what protects the jar.

## 0.5.4

### Added

- `oc session ls` lists saved sessions (name, url, title, `[cookies]` when a
  jar is held) and `oc session rm [name]` forgets one: saved page plus
  cookies, the same promise `oc logout` makes. `rm` fails on an unknown name
  rather than reporting success. A session name can no longer end in
  `.cookies`, which collided with the shorter name's cookie sidecar. State
  lives in `~/.only-cli` (`%USERPROFILE%\.only-cli` on Windows, `OC_HOME`
  overrides), so agents can now inspect and drop it without guessing paths.
- Login docs gained a PowerShell equivalent (`$h | oc login --cookie - ...`),
  since Windows has no `printf`.
- The CLI test harness resolves the binary with `fileURLToPath`, so the CLI
  tests can execute on Windows checkouts (`.pathname` breaks on drive-letter
  paths with spaces). The cookie file-mode test still fails there.

### Fixed

- A feed entry's title is now the link to the entry, so `oc do <n>` on a post
  in a subreddit feed opens it. The link used to sit beside the byline as an
  anchor labelled `open`, the same label on every entry, and the
  repeated-controls filter hid them all on any feed with five or more entries,
  which left nothing in a listing that led anywhere: an agent asked to open
  the first post's comments got the heading text back, refetched the feed
  looking for the link, and met Reddit's 429 (#59).

### Changed

- `oc open` on a reddit.com front page, subreddit, post, user or search URL
  fetches the matching www.reddit.com Atom feed when no login session is
  held, since the HTML page ends at a login wall for a logged-out reader.
  Following a post out of a feed lands on its comments feed instead of the
  wall. A URL that is already a feed, any other reddit.com path, and any
  request carrying reddit.com cookies are fetched as asked (#59).

## 0.5.3

### Changed

- Requests to reddit.com present the Firefox fingerprint first and fall back
  to Chrome, the reverse of every other site. Reddit's edge answers the Chrome
  fingerprint with a 403 or a 429 while letting Firefox through, and since it
  allows anonymous readers about ten requests a minute per address, the wasted
  Chrome attempt was costing a real share of that budget on every read (#52).

## 0.5.2

### Changed

- `oc reddit` reads the Atom feeds on www.reddit.com instead of old.reddit.com
  pages. Reddit has sent every logged-out old.reddit.com request to a login
  page since 30 June 2026, and the `.json` views on www.reddit.com have
  answered 403 to anything without an OAuth token since 30 May, whatever the
  User-Agent or TLS fingerprint. The feeds still answer, so `sub`, `post`,
  `user`, and `search` point at them, and `new <name>` and `top <name>` join
  the verbs. A subreddit renders in about 480 tokens and a thread with 22
  comments in about 1,000. The feeds carry no scores or comment counts, and
  anonymous reddit.com allows roughly ten requests a minute per address, so a
  burst of shortcuts ends in a 429 that takes minutes to clear. (#52)

## 0.5.1

### Added

- `find <query>` in every `actions:` footer, after `do <n>` and before
  `read <n>`, the order the skill's "going further, cheapest first" list
  already gives. One command lands on the block that matters, where `read`
  needs the right number first and `next` pages toward it. The entry costs 3
  or 4 tokens per render. (#46)

### Fixed

- `oc open` no longer dies with `Impersonating chrome150 is not supported` on
  machines where impers loads a system copy of libcurl-impersonate older than
  v2.1.0, which predates the fingerprint the `chrome` alias resolves to. A
  refused fingerprint now downgrades the same way a blocked response already
  did: chrome falls back to firefox, and when both identities are refused the
  plain fetch transport still gets the page. Any other impers failure
  propagates unchanged, and installs where impers works keep the newest chrome
  fingerprint. (#40)
- The `actions:` footer no longer offers `fill <n> <text>` and `submit` on
  pages with an input. Both are still planned, and following the footer's
  own suggestion always failed. A test now keeps every footer free of
  commands that are not available yet. (#44)

## 0.5.0

### Added

- Language documentation shortcuts: `py`, `mdn`, `node`, `ruby`, `go`, `rust`,
  `java`, `php`, `cpp`, and `ts`, plus a `dotnet` verb on `learn` for the .NET
  API browser. `search` on `py`, `node`, and `ruby` ranks the docs' own search
  index locally and on `mdn` asks the site's API; the sites that only render
  docs search client-side go through DuckDuckGo with a baked-in `site:` filter
  instead. (#25)
- Authenticated sessions: `oc login` seeds cookies for a session and every
  fetch in that session sends them; `oc logout` forgets a session early,
  cookies and saved page both. Cookies live in a per-session jar under
  `OC_HOME`, separate from page state, pinned to the exact host they were
  seeded for, and marked secure by default so they travel over https only
  (`--allow-http` at login opts a plain-http site in). A session lasts an hour
  unless `--expires` says otherwise. `--cookie -` reads the header from stdin,
  the form to prefer since an argv secret is visible in `ps` and kept in shell
  history. (#4)

### Fixed

- Response bodies are bounded at every transport, 25MB decoded, checked
  against `Content-Length` before the bytes arrive and counted as they land,
  so a hostile URL is no longer an unbounded allocation and a decompression
  bomb stops at the cap. (#27)
- Titles, headings, and input names are cut at the render boundary like every
  other block, so one hostile page-written scalar can no longer print
  unbounded output whatever the budget said. The distilled page keeps the
  full values and `--json` stays the machine-stable view. (#28)
- A short page is judged unreadable by evidence, not by length alone: nothing
  extracted is empty whatever the page weighed, and a short render only fails
  when the markup behind it was far too big to have carried only that. A
  status endpoint or a one-line answer now exits 0; script-only shells and
  consent walls still exit 2. (#29)

## 0.4.0

### Added

- Site shortcuts are dispatched, not just documented. `oc <site> <verb> [args]`
  resolves to a URL and then takes the same path `oc open` does, so it costs the
  same and reads the same. A site is named by short name, bare name, or domain
  (`oc hn`, `oc ycombinator`, `oc news.ycombinator.com`), the last argument
  absorbs every word after it so a query needs no quoting, and `oc sites` lists
  every site with its verbs. Shortcuts come from `clis/*.json`, so adding a site
  is a JSON file and no code. (#19)
- Wikipedia shortcuts: `oc wiki article <title>`, `oc wiki search <query>`, and
  `oc wiki lang <code> <title>` for the other language editions. Articles are
  read through `action=render`, which serves the article body without the site
  chrome, navigation, and edit controls that surround `/wiki/<Title>`. (#22)
- Outbound fetches honor `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`, including
  the lowercase forms, so oc works in a sandbox whose only route out is a proxy.
  HTTP and HTTPS proxies are supported and proxy credentials in the URL are
  sent as `Proxy-Authorization`. (#17)
- The MIT `LICENSE` file that the badge and `package.json` were already
  claiming. (#18)

### Changed

- A page that distills to no readable text now fails loud instead of printing an
  empty render and exiting 0. It writes one line to stderr and exits 2, which is
  distinct from the exit 1 every other failure uses, so a caller can tell "this
  page is empty" from "oc could not read this page" and fall back to a browser
  only when that is worth doing. `--json` carries the same verdict as an `empty`
  field. (#20)
- The SSRF guard runs before a proxy is chosen, so a proxied request cannot be
  used to reach an address the direct path would have refused. (#17)

### Fixed

- GitHub and Reddit shortcut URL templates corrected so their verbs reach the
  pages they name. (#19)
